## About Me
I'm an MD/PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis.  My interests include systems neuroscience, data science, and psychiatry.  I perform high channel count electrophysiological recordings from rodent brains during spontaneous behavior in the [Hengen lab](https://hengenlab.org).  I also occassionally write about medicine and make electronic music.
