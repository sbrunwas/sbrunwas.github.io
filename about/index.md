## About Me
I'm an MD/PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis.  My interests include systems neuroscience, data science, and psychiatry.  I study the dynamics of large populations of neurons in behaving rodents, and how these dynamics are disrupted in diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease in the [Hengen lab](https://hengenlab.org).  I also occassionally write about medicine and make electronic music.
