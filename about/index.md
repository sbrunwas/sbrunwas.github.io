## About Me
Hi!  My name is Sam and I'm an MD/PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis.  For a long time I've been fascinated by the brain and its seemingly overwhelming complexity.  It's my hope that by advancing our understanding of the basic circuits and systems of the brain, we will spur the development of innovative treatments for neurologic and psychiatric disorders - some of the most taxing and challenging diseases to treat.

I completed my PhD work in the [Hengen lab](https://hengenlab.org), where I studied the dynamics of large populations of neurons across the sleep/wake cycle and how these dynamics are disrupted in conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease.  You can peruse my scholarly works on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aS5SFZcAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

For fun, my creative pursuits include narrative medicine and producing electronic music.  If you're interested, you can read some of my writing in [this anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Tomorrows-Doctors-Tolu-Kehinde/dp/1512603333) or in the [Hippocrene](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/7/1374/files/2018/07/Hippocrene-2016-16rwxec.pdf), Wash U med's arts magazine.

I'm excited to announce that I will be starting residency in pediatric neurology this summer at UC San Francisco!
